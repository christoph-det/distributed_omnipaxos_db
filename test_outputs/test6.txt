All nodes are connected to one another
The nodes are:

Established quorumloss scenario:
The only connections now are the connections between node 1 and the others

Handle leader change at node 1 from Some(5) to Some(1)
Node 1 got promoted to leader
Handle leader change at node 2 from Some(5) to Some(1)
Handle leader change at node 5 from Some(5) to Some(1)
Node 5 lost leadership
Handle leader change at node 3 from Some(5) to Some(1)
Handle leader change at node 4 from Some(5) to Some(1)
The new leader is 1
The nodes are:
NodeID: 2, isRunning true, CurrentLeader: 1 ReplicatedDurability: 0, MemoryDurability: 0, OmniPaxosDecided: 0 Connections: [1], ReceivedMessagesSize: 11 KB
NodeID: 1, isRunning true, CurrentLeader: 1 ReplicatedDurability: 0, MemoryDurability: 0, OmniPaxosDecided: 0 Connections: [2, 4, 3, 5], ReceivedMessagesSize: 18 KB

QC node 1 is elected as leader
Creating transaction with key: TxKey01710271828436783000
Node 1 is advancing replicated durability offset
Node 5 is applying replicated transactions
Node 4 is applying replicated transactions
Node 3 is applying replicated transactions
Node 2 is applying replicated transactions
Transaction commited by leader 1 gets replicated correctly
