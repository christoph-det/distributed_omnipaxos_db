Two transactions commited, offsets correctly advanced.

Killing the leader.
Node 5 is shutting down
Handle leader change at node 4 from Some(5) to Some(4)
Node 4 got promoted to leader
Handle leader change at node 1 from Some(5) to Some(1)
Node 1 got promoted to leader
Handle leader change at node 3 from Some(5) to Some(3)
Node 3 got promoted to leader
Handle leader change at node 2 from Some(5) to Some(2)
Node 2 got promoted to leader
Handle leader change at node 1 from Some(1) to Some(4)
Node 1 lost leadership
Handle leader change at node 3 from Some(3) to Some(4)
Node 3 lost leadership
Handle leader change at node 2 from Some(2) to Some(4)
Node 2 lost leadership

One transaction commited, offset correctly advanced, old leader is not changing anymore.
Node 5 is not following the leader, so it is not expected to have the data yet
Replicated data is correct at all nodes.
